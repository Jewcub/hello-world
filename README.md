Just getting started, please be patient!
I'm learning python now, just finished with some online courses and looking for practice projects. I eventually want to do software development and I know python is not the best language for that but I'd like to get some more experience in an easier to learn language before jumping to C ++ or Java. 
I'm interested in Educational Technology, particularly in how we can integrate technology into the secondary school classroom.
